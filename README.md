# SIMPLE_IMAGE_EDITOR

This is just a simple image editor I made trying to learn a little more about tKinter.

For starters, I mainly us Py Charm to create stuff in Python. If you open it up and start a new project, 
copy the contents of main.py into your main.py, and install all of the packages needed it should work when you hit run.

With this you could use something like Auto-Py-To-Exe to make an executable file that will just run in Windows.

There aren't a lot of features in this one, but I thought it was neat and it was fun to build.

This was built following a tutorial on a YouTube channel called Clear Code by user @ClearCode. There are quite a few very good tutorials on this channel.
Some that I am/will be using to create my own game in Python (not just copying their work).
